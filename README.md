This mod adds a long range turret to the game.

[h3]Features[/h3]
[list]
[*]Turret fires 5 projectiles, each roughly equivilent to a High Explosive Mortar Shell from the base game
[*]Requires fueling with High Explosive Mortar shells (Capacity 100)
[*]Real smoke trails from the turret when it fires !
[*]Lots of values for the turret configurable in settings to tune to how balanced you want it to be
[*]Can also be set to intercept aerial attackers in the settings (Enemy Drop Pods etc.)
[/list]


[h3]Mod Compatibility[/h3]
In theory it should be compatible with everything, if you're using an exported mod from someone else then you will need any mods they decided to include on the ship otherwise the thing won't spawn and might throw an error.

[h3]Known Issues[/h3]
[list]
[*]None yet !
[/list]


[h2]The Point Of This Mod[/h2]
Part of a series of mods I've had for myself for a while that have either terrible graphics (that's not going to be fixed, unless someone gives me some better art to put in) or were atrociously balanced (So I've added the settings page)

[h2]Future Plans[/h2]
[list]
[*]None, this is complete for me so probably won't be adding anything unless someone gives me a really good idea.
