This mod takes Gravships found in my other mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3576790938]Gravship Exporter[/url] and randomly adds POIs to the map where a crashing ship may be found.
The gravship will be without GravEngine (why do you think it crashed !) and may be significantly damaged, or hardly damaged at all, there may also be survivors, who wont take kindly to you coming to strip their ship for parts, or them for kidneys...

For this mod I need some feedback in the comments please :)  I'm not sure if it's balanced perfectly (or even at all) for the random loot or defenders etc. so any feedback on that kind of thing very much appreciated :D

[h3]Features[/h3]
[list]
[*]Grav Engine replaced with a Broken Grav Engine that you can dismantle for spare parts (multiple Grav Engines on the same map annoys base Rimworld)
[*]POIs generated randomly containing a crashed Gravship for you to plunder/loot
[*]Items, structures and Pawns on the ship will be randomly damaged to simulate a crash
[*]Random loot spawned to reward you for attacking
[*]Defenders spawned (Rules for this, 1 Defending Pawn per Bed, if no Beds then per seat, if no seats then per 20 cells of ship)
[*]Turrets powered and fuel required buildings partially fueled
[*]Damage levels can be tuned in the mod settings as can the chances for the event to spawn
[/list]


[h3]Mod Compatibility[/h3]
In theory it should be compatible with everything, if you're using an exported mod from someone else then you will need any mods they decided to include on the ship otherwise the thing won't spawn and might throw an error.
